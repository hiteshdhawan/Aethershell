[![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/hiteshdhawan/Aethershell?label=Download%20Latest)](https://github.com/hiteshdhawan/Aethershell/releases)

**AetherShell** is an AI-powered, offline Linux shell assistant that interprets natural language, plans tasks, and securely executes commands using a local LLM (Mistral-7B). Designed for privacy-first terminal automation.

---

## üöÄ Why AetherShell?

- **Offline and Secure:** No internet dependency ‚Äî all AI runs locally.
- **Natural Language Interface:** Replace cryptic shell syntax with plain English.
- **Local LLM:** Integrates `llama-cpp` and Mistral for fast, private AI inference.
- **Productive by Design:** Multi-step command execution and persistent memory.
- **Ideal For:** Developers, sysadmins, AI enthusiasts, and privacy-conscious users.


---

## Features ‚Äî Smarter, Safer, AI-Enhanced Terminal

### 1. Natural Language Shell Commands
Interact with your Linux terminal in plain English:

> ‚ÄúCreate a folder called `test` and open it.‚Äù

AetherShell understands and converts it to:

```bash
mkdir test && cd test
```

- Skip memorizing complex syntax  
- Ideal for both beginners and advanced users  
- Fast, intuitive command translation

---

### 2. Local AI Integration (LLM-powered)
Powered by `llama-cpp` and Mistral-7B, AetherShell runs entirely offline on your machine.

> ‚ÄúList the 10 biggest files in this directory.‚Äù

AetherShell understands and converts it to:
```bash
du -ah | sort -rh | head -n 10
```

- No internet required  
- Maximum privacy and performance  
- Works on air-gapped systems

---

### 3. Dynamic Multi-Step Execution
AetherShell understands and executes multi-step tasks intelligently.

> ‚ÄúInstall Python, create a virtual environment, and activate it.‚Äù

```bash
sudo apt install python3
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

- Automates routine tasks  
- Reduces manual effort  
- Task planning handled by AI

---

### 4. Memory Persistence
AetherShell saves session history and context in a structured format (`aether_memory.json`).

- Maintains task continuity  
- Remembers prior commands  
- Enables contextual conversations

---

### 5. Offline Capability
All features work without an internet connection.

- Fully self-contained  
- No external API calls  
- Perfect for private, secure environments

---

### 6. Optional Cloud Fallback (WIP)
Future support for hybrid execution using cloud models when needed.

- Seamless switch to cloud using claude, gemini, etc. 
- Useful for low-end systems  
- Still prioritizes local-first privacy
- This feature will only be executed, if allowed by the user.

---

### 7. Secure Execution Sandbox (WIP)
AetherShell will feature isolated environments to run commands securely.

- Limits system-level access  
- Helps prevent accidental damage  
- Ideal for testing and sandboxed execution
- Ideal for script development.

---

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `curl`
- Linux OS (Debian-based recommended)
- At least 6 GB RAM for LLM execution
  
## Prerequisites

Before running `setup.sh`, ensure the following tools are installed on your system:

- `curl` ‚Äì for downloading the model
